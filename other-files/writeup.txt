What corrections did you have to make?
I had a missing language error, so I had to specify <html lang="en"> for the screen reader to work.

Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?
I think with where we are in image processing, we can detect and label objects like a mountain. But given that users can post a large variety of content and a lot of it about people in their lives, I think a screen reader would struggle.

Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
Yes. While the contents are not aesthetically appealing, it is certainly usable as you can look at pictures, usernames, captions, and comments.


Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?
I couldn't figure out how to "turn off" the images. Does that mean remove all the image tags?
